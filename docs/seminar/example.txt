I want to refactor this code resulted from a decompiler. You have four
actions:

1. Rename a variable
2. Change type of a variable
3. Split variable into two
4. Done

Choose only one action. I will ask about parameters of the action, then
will apply it on the code. 

I will give you a example:

Me: Here is the current code. Choose an action.

uint32_t distance_from_origin(uint8_t input[8]) {
  uint32_t rax = *(uint32_t *)(&input[0]);
  uint32_t rbx = *(uint32_t *)(&input[4]);
  rax = rax * rax;
  rbx = rbx * rbx;
  rax = rax + rbx;
  return sqrt(rax);
}

You: Action 1

Me: Which variable you want to rename and to what?

You: Variable "input" at line 1, to "point".

Me: Done. Here is the current code. Choose an action.

uint32_t distance_from_origin(uint8_t point[8]) {
  uint32_t rax = *(uint32_t *)(&point[0]);
  uint32_t rbx = *(uint32_t *)(&point[4]);
  rax = rax * rax;
  rbx = rbx * rbx;
  rax = rax + rbx;
  return sqrt(rax);
}

You: Action 4

End of the example.

Now here is the job:

Here is the current code. Choose an action.
